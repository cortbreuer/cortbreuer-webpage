## About Me

I am an undergraduate student (junior) at Cornell University studying Biological Engineering. I currently work in the [Lee Lab](https://leelab.bme.cornell.edu/) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, focusing on interactions between immune cells and endothelial cells in tumors.

## Research
---

### 1. Viral vectors for the immune system

While part of the [Moon Lab](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/ciid/research-labs/james-moon), I worked on applying recent work on exosome-associated AAV by the [Maguire Lab](http://www.casey-maguire-laboratory.com/about) for gene therapy delivery to immune cells. We demonstrated that intravenous injection of exo-AAV into mice could effectively transduce immune cells in the blood, lymph nodes, and spleen - allowing for the expression of a GFP marker or human IL-2Ra.

### 2. Lymphatic endothelial cells and vessels in cancer immunity

In the [Lee Lab](https://leelab.bme.cornell.edu/), I primarily work on projects investigating the interaction of immune cells and blood/lymphatic endothelial cells, especially in cancer. I make use of in vitro organ-on-a-chip models of lymphatic vessels and mouse tumor models of melanoma and breast cancer. Two on-going projects include investigation of how antigen processing and archival by lymphatic endothelial cells affects T cell activation and studies targeting tumor-associated lymphatic vessels to enhance checkpoint blockade therapy.

### 3. Next-generation vaccines for pancreatic cancer

As part of a collaboration between the Lee Lab and Weill Cornell investigators, I have recently been working on a pilot project for enhancing cell-based cancer vaccines with the potential for personalized treataments for patients.

## Outreach
---

1. Cornell Biomedical Engineering Society

As Treasurer and former Professional Development Chair, I have helped lead the BMES organization to foster community among biomedical engineering students and increase interest in the field through philanthropy, outreach, and industry recruitment events.

2. Cornell Undergraduate Research Board

I mentor underclassmen in CURB each semester as part of the Research Mentorship program, advising students on matching research with their interests and finding opportunities with professors. A key goal of the program is to introduce diverse students to research who would otherwise not have the opportunity or chance to participate.

3. Course Teaching Assistant

I work as an undergraduate teaching assistant for courses in biological engineering and thermodynamics/kinetics. I support the course by grading assignments and exams, holding weekly office hours with students, and ensuring teaching technology is functioning.
